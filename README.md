# gossip-glomers
My code for the [Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) series of distributed systems challenges created by [fly.io](https://fly.io/) and [Kyle Kingsbury](https://aphyr.com/about) (author of [Jepsen](https://jepsen.io/)).

# Repository notes
Main methods for each challenge can be found under the `cmd/` folder. Building with `go install ./...` creates executables under `$HOME/go/bin` that have the same names as the containing folder.

# Blog posts
As I complete challenges, I'll also make writeups on my blog. You can find all posts with the [Gossip Glomers tag](https://lynshi.github.io/tags/gossip-glomers/) and I'll also link them here!
